# Python Async Comprehensions Project

## Introduction

This project focuses on understanding and implementing asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python. You will learn how to write asynchronous generators, use async comprehensions, and type-annotate generators.

## Resources

Read or watch:

- [PEP 530 – Asynchronous Comprehensions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/)
- [What’s New in Python: Asynchronous Comprehensions / Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#pep-530-asynchronous-comprehensions)
- [Type-hints for generators](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#generators-and-coroutines)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to write an asynchronous generator
- How to use async comprehensions
- How to type-annotate generators

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation should be a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
