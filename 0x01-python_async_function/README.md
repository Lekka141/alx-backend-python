# Python Async Functions Project

## Overview

This project is focused on understanding and implementing asynchronous functions in Python using the `asyncio` module. The key concepts covered include async and await syntax, executing async programs, running concurrent coroutines, creating asyncio tasks, and utilizing the random module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the `async` and `await` syntax.
- Execute an async program with `asyncio`.
- Run concurrent coroutines.
- Create `asyncio` tasks.
- Use the `random` module effectively.

## Requirements

- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder.
- All files must be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7).
- All files should end with a new line and be executable.
- Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All modules should have documentation.
- All functions should have documentation.
